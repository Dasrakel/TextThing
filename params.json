The fixed default file path is `Documents/click.dummer.textthing/notes.txt` . If you open the app, this file will be opened, created and used for store. There is no file manager integrated!\r\n\r\nSupport me: <a href=\"https://flattr.com/submit/auto?fid=o6wo7q&url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fno-go%2FTextThing\" target=\"_blank\">![Flattr This](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/no-go/TextThing/master/flattr-badge-large.png)</a>\r\n\r\n## App Icon\r\n\r\n![The App Icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/no-go/TextThing/master/icon.png)\r\n\r\n## Features since Version 1.9\r\n\r\n- Themes: Retro, Day, Night\r\n- Donate/Homepage Link added\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\nThe blue colors are fixed and based on the 1980er C64 Homecomputer.
